              <p>At informal meals, place the napkin in your lap immediately upon seating. During formal occasions, before unfolding the napkin, wait for the hostess to remove her napkin from the table and unfold it in her lap.
              </p>
              <p>1. Place the napkin in your lap upon seating.
                 2. When leaving the table temporarily, put the napkin on your chair.
                 3. At the meal's end, fold your napkin and place it to the left of your place setting.

                <p>The continental style prevails at all meals, formal and informal, because it is a natural, non-disruptive way to eat.</p>
                <p>
                  1. Hold your fork in your left hand, tines downward.
                  2. Hold your knife in your right hand, an inch or two above the plate.
                  3. Extend your index finger along the top of the blade.
                  4. Use your fork to spear and lift food to your mouth.

                    Deciding which knife, fork, or spoon to use is made easier by the outside-in rule – use utensils on the outside first and working your way inward. So, if you are served a salad first, use the fork set to the far left of your plate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Your water glass is the one above the knife in your place setting and your bread plate is to the left. To remember which bread plate belongs to you and if the glass in front of you belongs to you or your neighbor, use “b” and “d”. Touch the index finger on your right hand to your right thumb. Touch the index finger on your left hand to your left thumb. The “b” formed by your left hand is for “bread” (your bread plate is always at the left of your place setting). The “d” formed by your right hand is for “drink” (your drinking glasses are always at the right of your place setting).

                    How do you leave your knife and fork on your plate when taking a break or are finished eating?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When you pause to take a sip of your beverage or to speak with someone, rest your utensils in one of the two following styles:

                      Continental Style: Place your knife and fork on your plate near the center, slightly angled in an inverted V and with the tips of the knife and fork pointing toward each other.

                      American Style: Rest your knife on the top right of your plate (diagonally) with the fork nearby (tines up).

                      When each course is finished:

                      Place the knife and fork parallel with the handles in the four o'clock position on the right rim of the plate.

                        At a formal affair, plates are removed by a professional staff. But as most informal meals are served without help, the hostess clears the plates, often with the help of a guest or two. At a family meal, members clear their own plates.
                        Clearing the Plates

                        1. If the meal is formal, plates will be removed by the staff.
                        2. At informal meals, the hostess will probably clear the plates, possibly with one or two guests helping.
                        3. At a family meal, members clear their own plates.

                        Leaving the dining room. To signal dinner is concluded, the hostess catches the eye of the host, lays her napkin on the table, and suggests that everyone go into another room for coffee and after-dinner drinks. The hostess rises from her chair.

                        When it's time to leave, rather than detain one's host with a lengthy good-bye, make the departure brief but cordial.
